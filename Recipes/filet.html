            </p>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup coarsely crushed black peppercorns</li>
            <li>4 (6 ounce) 1 1/2 inch thick filet mignon steaks</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1/3 cup beef broth</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        </ul>
    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1 <br>
                <p>Place the peppercorns into a shallow bowl. Sprinkle the
                beef tenderloin filets with salt on both sides, and coat
                boath sides with crushed peppercorns.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Step 2 <br>
                <p>Melt the butter with the olive oil over high heat in a heavy
                    skillet (not nonstick) until the foam disappears from the butter.
                    Gently place the steaks in the pan, and cook until they start to 
                    become firm and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 
                    3 1/2 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into
                    the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Remove the steaks
                    to platter, and cover tightly with foil.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Step 3 <br>
                <p>Pour the beef broth into the skillet, and use a whisk to stir the broth 
                    and scrape up any dissolved brown flavor bits from the skillet. Whisk in
                    cream, and simmer the sauce until it's reduced and thickened, 6 to 7 minutes.
                    Place the steaks back in the skillet, turn to coat with sauce, and serve with
                    the remaining sauce.</p>
